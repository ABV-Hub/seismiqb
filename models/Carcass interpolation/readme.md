Notebooks to showcase our solution to the task of enlarging the horizon from a (very) sparce carcass:

* First of all, a full pipeline of actions is demonstrated on two different seismic cubes in [Demo_M]('01_Demo_M.ipynb') and [Demo_E]('01_Demo_E.ipynb') notebooks. The first one is a very thick and distinct horizon; the latter is a touch harder, with faults and noises

* [Research]('02_Iterative_research.ipynb') and its [results]('02_Iterative_results.ipynb') are presented in separate files. Those show our postprocessing steps, namely extension and enhancement of horizons that can be applied to any labeled surface
